      overview: "The Vision, Hands, Sesame 2026 hackathon represents a groundbreaking initiative that brings together researchers, developers, and educators from around the world to advance our understanding of how children process and learn from educational media. This collaborative event focuses on developing innovative computer vision and neuroscience tools for analyzing children's responses to visual content in educational programming.",
      methodology: "Our research methodology combines cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques with advanced computer vision algorithms. We utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor brain activity in children aged 3-8 while they viewed specific Sesame Street episodes. Simultaneously, our computer vision models analyzed the visual content frame-by-frame, identifying characters, objects, and educational elements. This dual approach allows us to correlate specific visual stimuli with neural responses, providing unprecedented insights into how children's brains process educational content.",
      findings: [
        "Children show significantly increased activation in the fusiform face area when viewing familiar characters like Elmo and Big Bird",
        "Educational content featuring numbers activates both visual processing and mathematical reasoning areas of the brain",
        "Character interactions that model prosocial behavior correlate with increased activity in empathy-related brain regions",
        "Visual attention patterns differ significantly between educational and entertainment content segments"
      ],
      implications: "These findings have profound implications for educational media design and child development research. By understanding how specific visual elements activate different brain regions, content creators can design more effective educational programming that optimally engages children's cognitive and emotional systems.",
